      <p>“On the internet, nobody knows you’re a dog,” the famous New Yorker cartoon says. Accurate identification and authentication is still the great unsolved problem of the internet; we still can’t tell the good guys from the bad. If we could, 
        we’d block the bad ones and let the good ones through. Our failure to do so is the primary reason why our global economy loses trillions of dollars annually to fraud-related costs. Make no mistake: traditional siloed identity is the main 
        culprit here. The third-party IDP model had promise when it first arose, but seemingly intractable problems remain. Bottom line: the current identity models are broken and in crisis; we need a revolutionary step forward.
        <br><br> This permissioned blockchain model for a Secure Trust Composer creates verifiable permanence for evidence-based claims to personally identifiable information by adding a stamp of approval by Issuers and due diligence by Assessors to enable transparent decision-making by aid-giving Services (disaster relief organizations) by creating trusted transactions. Participants in this network have a more level relation
        among each other, and access balance are in the centric position to connect Users in need to the Resources they may be entitled to in the event of natural disasters.
        <br><br> Because Hyperledger Indy was too cumbersome, we leveraged the loyal program composer code pattern to create this Secure Trust Composer as a blockchain web application (deployable on the IBM Cloud) using Hyperledger Composer API and Node.js. The application will allow members to register on the network where they will create their account. Users will also be able to prove their bank balance by authenticating with Plaid API, and upload evidence through the InterPlanitary File System (IPFS).
        They will be identified on the network with their unique name and will create a access key which they will use to sign in. This access key is used as the card id for making transactions and querying records. Members can view their transactions as 
        part of the blockchain ledger. We omitted for simplicity the use of permissions as part of the network where a member can only view their transactions.
